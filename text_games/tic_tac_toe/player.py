"""The game of Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) made using python.

Tic tac toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns
marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.  The player who succeeds in placing three of
their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If no player
succeeds in achieving such a pattern and the grib has no empty spaces left, there
is a draw.

There is a one player option where the user gets to play against the computer
and a two player option when the user wants to play with a friend.
